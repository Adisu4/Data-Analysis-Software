#Medical Device Failure Classification and Predictive Maintenance
Description
This project introduces a machine learning framework for predictive maintenance and failure classification in healthcare. It addresses challenges like heterogeneous device data and varying failure patterns, achieving 85% classification accuracy using a Naive Bayes model trained on AAMI failure codes. The system analyzes 1,796 work orders from 4,000+ medical devices across 48 hospitals (2021-2024) and provides dynamic maintenance recommendations to reduce unplanned downtime and optimize resource allocation.
#Key Features
Automated Failure Classification: 85% accuracy using Naive Bayes on AAMI failure codes.
Dynamic Maintenance Recommendations: Tailored suggestions based on device usage and failure trends.
Adaptive Visualization: Tools for temporal trend analysis with statistical error quantification.
Nomenclature Standardization: Unified naming conventions across device manufacturers.
Scalable Integration: Seamless integration with hospital management systems.
#Technologies Used
Machine Learning: Naive Bayes, Scikit-learn.
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Backend: Python, Flask (optional for deployment).
Data Storage: SQL/NoSQL databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).
